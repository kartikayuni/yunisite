# Welcome to Errorist

If you see this in your browser, you've got both Hugo and Errorist installed. Congratulations!

This will soon become your website. The [Manual]({{< ref "manual" >}}) section on the left has a
couple of tutorials to walk you through the setup process. 

This base project comes preconfigured with two languages, English and Russian. The latter was chosen
as a contrasting example for demonstrating multilingual features of Errorist theme.
Adding and removing languages is very easy.

Once you are ready to publish your site, follow the clean-up instructions on this page to remove
manuals, the test content that you have created and this page itself.

For now, let's [play a bit]({{< ref "manual" >}}).
