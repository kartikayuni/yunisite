I’m Yuni, a native speaker and teacher of Indonesian language, and I invite you to learn Bahasa
Indonesia online with me. I offer individual Bahasa Indonesia classes over Skype. As a teacher I see
my goal to make you speak Bahasa Indonesia within the shortest time possible.

My quality guarantee in essence is: if you book a single lesson and are dissatisfied with the
quality, you do not have to pay. Yes, you can just walk away: I’m neither asking for your credit
card number nor for a pre-payment. This should eliminate all your doubts at their root.
