If you are a new customer, just send me a message. Please provide a few possible times for your
first lesson, and optionally write in a few words, what is your motivation to learn Bahasa
Indonesia. I shall respond to your message within 48 hours (likely sooner). We shall have our first
lesson.

If, for whatever reason, you are not satisfied with the quality of your lesson, feel free not to
pay. Of course, that implies there will be no further lessons. This should eliminate your doubts at
their root: all your risk is just about one hour of your time.

If you are satisfied with the quality, I expect you to pay for the lesson taken. After that, you can
book your next individual Bahasa Indonesia lesson.

You’ve also got an option to book a package of lessons, in which case you will get a generous
discount. In addition, there will be lower money transfer costs per lesson as well. Lesson packages
must be fully prepaid and are not refundable, so buy them once you are confident in me as a teacher
of Indonesian language.

## Scheduling

I give the paying customers higher priority compared to the new ones. Other than that, I schedule my
lessons on the “first come, first served” basis. In order to schedule a lesson, I need to receive
the payment for all lessons you have previously taken. I check the payments once a day at 9:00 am
Jakarta time (GMT+7).

As a rule, I schedule my lessons only within the next 3 month timeframe.  Payment methods

I accept direct payments to my bank account. The easiest and cheapest option is to use an online
service called TransferWise. The associated costs are much lower than using Paypal (or any other
online payment processing agent known to me). If you use the referral link, TransFerwise promises
you a free transfer of up to 500 Euros.
